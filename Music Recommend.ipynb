    "    A Music Recommendation System is an application of Data Science that aims to assist users in discovering new and relevant musical content based on their preferences and listening behaviour. Personalized music recommendations have become an essential tool in the digital music landscape, enabling music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to offer personalized and engaging experiences to their users. If you want to learn how to build a music recommendation system, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through building a Music Recommendation System using Spotify API and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How Does a Music Recommendation System Work?\n",
    "    Music Recommendation Systems operate through intricate algorithms that analyze vast amounts of data about users’ musical interactions, such as their listening history, liked tracks, skipped songs, and even explicit user preferences conveyed through ratings or feedback. These data points are instrumental in constructing comprehensive user profiles, delineating individual tastes and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the initial phase, the system employs various data preprocessing techniques to cleanse and organize the information efficiently. Subsequently, the system uses recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, to generate music recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As users continually interact with the system, it accumulates additional data, refining and updating their profiles in real time. Consequently, the recommendations become increasingly precise and aligned with the user’s evolving musical preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    What is Spotify API & How to build a Music Recommendation System using Spotify API?\n",
    "    The Spotify API is a set of rules and protocols provided by Spotify developers. It enables developers to interact with Spotify’s vast music catalogue and collect music-related data. Through the Spotify API, developers can access information such as tracks, albums, artists, playlists, user profiles, and play history, among other features, empowering them to build innovative applications and services that integrate seamlessly with the Spotify platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To build a Music Recommendation System using the Spotify API, we are required to collect real-time music data from Spotify. For this task, we need a Spotify developer account to get our credentials from Spotify to access their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Below is the process you can follow to sign up for the Spotify developer account and get your credentials."

It then uses the datetime.strptime function from the Python datetime module to convert the release date string to a datetime object. This conversion allows us to perform arithmetic operations with dates.

This results in a timedelta object representing the time difference between the two dates.\n",

Adding 1 to the number of days ensures that the weight is never zero, even for very recent releases, as this would lead to a division by zero error.\n",

    "    The hybrid approach aims to provide more personalized and relevant recommendations by considering both the content similarity of songs and their weighted popularity. The function takes input_song_name as the input, representing the name of the song for which recommendations are to be generated. The function first calls the content_based_recommendations function to get content-based recommendations for the input song. The num_recommendations parameter determines the number of content-based recommendations to be retrieved.\n",

It also calculates the weighted popularity score using the calculate_weighted_popularity function (previously defined) based on the release date of the input song. The alpha parameter controls the relative importance of content-based and popularity-based recommendations.\n",

The function combines the content-based recommendations with the input song’s information (track name, artists, album name, release date, and popularity) and its weighted popularity score. This step creates a DataFrame named hybrid_recommendations that includes both the content-based recommendations and the input song’s data.\n",

This step ensures that the most popular and relevant songs appear at the top of the recommendations.
